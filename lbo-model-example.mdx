title: 'LBO Model'
description: 'Complex financial modeling task requiring sequential debt schedule calculations and interdependent cash flow analysis'
---

*Task ID: lbo2-mcp*

The agent is provided with assumptions and a partially completed LBO model. This task is particularly complex for a number of reasons:

Firstly, even though the line items in the FCF are listed in chronological order, the agent needs to first complete the debt schedule before it can calculate the interest and mandatory amortization. Trying to complete this process in a different order will lead the agent to the wrong answer.

Secondly, this task requires the agent to exercise significant domain knowledge about debt structures. We can see this through an excerpt from our assumptions document:

Thirdly, the agent has to make multiple intricate choices about how to properly use the available
tools. For the agent to find the correct federal interest rate, it needs to correctly enter proper date
ranges. Interest rate data is only released on the first of each month - if the agent doesn’t include
this date in its range, it will not get the correct results. For finding the exit multiple, before the
agent makes a call to the appropriate tool, the agent needs to identify that the EV/EBITDA
multiple should be used and identify the correct ticker symbols for the specified companies.
 
When the agent is completed with its work, we evaluate the agent’s resulting file against our
golden Excel sheet.
