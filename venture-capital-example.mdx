# Venture Capital Analysis
*Task ID: vc_darwin*

For this task, the agent has to fill out a set of increasingly complex tables in Excel corresponding to funding structures for each investment round. The sequential nature of the data means that each set of data points has a cascading effect - the agent won't be able to properly reach the correct values in later funding rounds without setting up a proper structure for the initial funding rounds.

Here is an image of one such completed table in the sheet:

The agent needs to use the Company Info Crunchbase function to access the size of the seed round, and then the agent needs to use the Crunchbase Funding Rounds function to access data on specific investors in the seed round. The second Crunchbase function requires the agent to provide a company uuid as a parameter - the agent will not be able to find this information without correctly calling the first Crunchbase function.

When the agent is completed with its work, we evaluate the agent's resulting file against our golden Excel sheet.


## Tools Used

- `getCrunchbaseCompanyInfo`  
  Retrieve company information from Crunchbase, including company uuid and funding details.

- `getCrunchbaseFundingRounds`  
  Retrieve detailed funding round data and investor information for a company, requires company uuid.

- `excel_read_data_from_excel`  
  Read data from an Excel file.

- `excel_write_data_to_excel`  
  Write data to an Excel file.

- `excel_apply_formula`  
  Apply formulas to cells in an Excel file.

## Example Workflow

1. `getCrunchbaseCompanyInfo`  
   Fetch company profile and capture the `uuid` needed for downstream calls.
2. `getCrunchbaseFundingRounds`  
   Query rounds using the company `uuid` to retrieve amounts, dates, and investors.
3. 'readDocument'
   Pull assumptions from the provided PDF.
3. `excel_read_data_from_excel`  
   Open the rounds/cap table worksheet.
4. `excel_write_data_to_excel`
   Populate round-by-round inputs (date, amount, pre/post, investors).
5. `excel_apply_formula`
   Compute dilution, ownership by round, and exit waterfall metrics.
