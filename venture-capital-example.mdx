# Venture Capital Analysis
*Task ID: vc_darwin*

For this task, the agent has to fill out a set of increasingly complex tables in Excel corresponding to funding structures for each investment round. The sequential nature of the data means that each set of data points has a cascading effect - the agent won't be able to properly reach the correct values in later funding rounds without setting up a proper structure for the initial funding rounds.

Here is an image of one such completed table in the sheet:

The agent needs to use the Company Info Crunchbase function to access the size of the seed round, and then the agent needs to use the Crunchbase Funding Rounds function to access data on specific investors in the seed round. The second Crunchbase function requires the agent to provide a company uuid as a parameter - the agent will not be able to find this information without correctly calling the first Crunchbase function.

When the agent is completed with its work, we evaluate the agent's resulting file against our golden Excel sheet.
