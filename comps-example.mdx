In this task, the agent needs to go through the process of creating a set of comparables for a target company in the pharmaceutical industry. This is a common part of making a DCF for an analyst at an investment bank. 

The first step in creating our comparables is to screen for a set of 5-10 companies that have similar characteristics to our target company. In this case, the agent is provided with a large list of US-based pharmaceutical companies with over $500 million in LTM revenue. This list includes key information about each company:

![Pharma Screening List](/images/comps/comps-screening-list.png)

Using the Excel tool, the agent needs to read the list of companies and then remove companies that don’t meet the following criteria: $1B to $5B in LTM Revenue, sell branded products (patents), and have a portfolio rather than just a single product. Some of this information exists on the sheet, but for other information such as the product distribution, the agent will need to query the Financial Market Tools or conduct other online research. 

Once the agent has completed screening the list, it should be left with 8 key companies. Then, the agent needs to input financial details for one of the companies, BioMarin (BMRN), into our financial model. After reading the Excel file, the agent should notice there are multiple sheets, one with the core DCF model, one with the Public Comps data, and one with the M&A Comps. It needs to select the Public Comps Data sheet and interpret the information that needs to be filled in:

</Frame>


Minor information about BMRN has already been filled in for the agent, such as some lookup variables and projection figures. To fill in the rest of the information, the agent will need to gather significant amounts of market data. The agent first needs to recognize that it needs to find the date this model is being completed on, which is available in the DCF sheet as Valuation Date: 

![Valuation Date Reference](/images/comps/comps-valuation-date.png)

Once the agent recognizes the date, it should look for the share price and beta of BMRN on that date using the getHistoricalPrices tool. The agent will also need to find the recent 10-K and 10-Q’s for the target company, which it can do through using the getSECFilings tool. This is relevant for filling in the balance sheet line items, finding the number of dilutive securities available, and calculating many of the other numbers in this section. This is one example output from the tool for BMRN’s 10-K’s:

   }

}
```

The agent will need to parse through the url of each appropriate filing and extract the relevant numbers. These filings can often extend to hundreds of pages. For the Diluted Shares Calculations, the agent needs to reference multiple pages across multiple different filings:

</Frame>

Once the agent has filled out all of the input sections, it can close out the task by calculating the valuation multiples based on the calendarized data for BMRN. 

Note: It often takes investment bankers multiple days-weeks of work to create a high-quality DCF. Therefore, we break each DCF into multiple smaller tasks representing workflows that often take >1 hour for an IB analyst to complete. We have seen that this is actually more valuable for the model training process as well. In this case, we have multiple other tasks for this DCF, including Comps 2, which involves inputting financial data for the other comparable companies that were screened, creating the comparables table from this aggregated data, and then using this information for projections with Jazz Pharmaceuticals.
