# Real Estate Model
*Task ID: re_model_ut*

Within this task, the agent needs to find a specified property listing and then fill in our existing real estate model with the appropriate projection data.

The agent first needs to find an ideal plot of land. We provide the agent with a complex set of specifications, including a pricing budget, a minimum number of square feet, and listing agent details. The agent needs to utilize our real estate tool to retrieve and filter through real-time data of property listings.

Once the agent finds the correct property, it needs to examine our provided assumptions and then fill in the model.

*Completed version of the model with filled in hard costs and soft costs.*

We can walk through a more specific example of the assumptions the agent needs to interpret.

The Assumptions table is provided both in the PDF and as its own Excel file. The agent needs to recognize that it has to combine numbers across units that have the same type, and then tie this back to square-foot data it retrieved from the tool.

When the agent is completed with its work, we evaluate the agent's resulting file against our golden Excel sheet.
