## Overview

The **Theta Playground** is our environment that allows agents to complete tasks using our MCP tools in an isolated environment. We then evaluate the model's success in completing the task.

## Quick Start

### 1. Execute an Autonomous Task

Start a streaming financial analysis task:

```bash
curl -N -X POST "https://playground.thetasoftware.ai/agent/tasks/{taskID}/execute/stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $THETA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1", # insert model-> 4o, 4o-mini, gpt-4.1, gpt4.1-mini, o1, o3, o3-pro, o3-mini
    "max_steps": 30,
    "openai_api_key": "'$OPENAI_API_KEY'"
  }'
```
This will:
1. Create an isolated workspace for the AI agent with the initstate of the task
2. Stream real-time actions as the model uses the tools to complete the task
3. Return and score

**Available Task IDs:**
- `calendarization` - Complex quarterly financial data calendarization task
- `lbo2-mcp` - LBO model completion with debt schedule calculations  
- `re_model_ut` - Real estate property search and financial modeling
- `vc_darwin` - Venture capital funding structure analysis

### 2. Watch Real-Time Execution

Example streaming response shows each step:
```json
data: {"type": "tool_call", "step": 1, "tool_name": "finance_get_income_statements", "arguments": {"ticker": "WMT", "period": "quarterly", "limit": 4}}
data: {"type": "tool_call", "step": 2, "tool_name": "finance_get_balance_sheets", "arguments": {"ticker": "WMT", "period": "quarterly", "limit": 4}}
data: {"type": "tool_call", "step": 3, "tool_name": "excel_create_workbook", "arguments": {"filepath": "Walmart_Calendarized_Financials.xlsx"}}
...
data: {"type": "execution_completed", "steps_executed": 9, "score": 0.0}

```

## Available Tools

The Theta Gateway provides access to **65+ professional tools** across six main categories. All tools use clean, intuitive names without client prefixes.

| Category | Tools | Description | Reference |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Excel** | 20+ tools | Create, manipulate, and analyze Excel workbooks | [Excel Tools →](/excel-tools) |
| **Public Financial Markets** | 17 tools | Real-time financial data from public markets and companies | [Financial Tools →](/financial-tools) |
| **Private Markets** | 2 tools | Private company data and funding information via Crunchbase | [Private Market Tools →](/private-market-tools) |
| **Real Estate** | 19 tools | Property data, valuations, market analysis, and construction costs | [Real Estate Tools →](/real-estate-tools) |
| **Accounting** | 9 tools | Double-entry accounting system via Ledger CLI | [Accounting Tools →](/accounting-tools) |
| **Document Processing** | 3 tools | Read and analyze various document formats | [Document Tools →](/document-tools) |




## Evaluation
Evaluating the agent’s ability to complete the task is a critical component of the learning process. We assess the final state of the environment and assign a score based on how effectively the agent accomplished the task. For example, in the Real Estate Model task, we evaluate the accuracy of the agent’s inputs and return a score on a scale from 0.00 to 1.00, reflecting how closely the model matches the expected outcome.
